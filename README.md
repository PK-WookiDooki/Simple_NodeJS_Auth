# Simple NodeJS Authentication

First clone this repository to your machine. Then open the whole folder in the VS Code. At an instance, you'll see the two folder named [backend](backend) & [client](client). Go to each folder and then open terminal and run

> ## npm install

command , this will download all required dependencies for running this application.

After the packages installation complete, first go the [backend](backend) folder and run this command

> ## npm start

in the terminal to start the server.

Now go to the [client](client) folder and run this command

> ## npm run dev

in the terminal to start the React JS development server. After all the above is done, you can test the app by changing the mysql database information in [index.js](backend/index.js). Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system or else it won't work properly.

## Note

This's the simple authentication app developed by using tools like NodeJS, JWTs, Bcrypt and ReactJS. Also this project for my learning purpose only. Please have a look and point me out the mistakes or errors I've made.
